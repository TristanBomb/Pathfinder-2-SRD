# Alchemist
> There’s no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling
in your laboratory’s beakers, and you consume your various creations
with abandon. Perhaps you’re fascinated with uncovering the secrets of
magic and science, or perhaps you simply like to watch volatile chemical
reactions. Regardless, you’re constantly experimenting in your lab or on
the go with inventive concoctions tweaked for any eventuality. With your
fearlessness in the face of risk, your unique path toward greatness is lined
with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits.

## Playing an Alchemist
Players of alchemist characters might approach gameplay in the following ways:
*  During combat, you lob bombs at your foes and harry your enemies while supporting the rest of your party with your potent elixirs.  At higher levels, you toughen your body using mutagens.
*  During social encounters, you provide knowledge and experience about alchemicalitems and related secrets, like poisons and diseases.
*  In exploration mode, you keep an eye out for truoble with your bombs at the ready while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious.
*  In downtime mode, you spend time in an alchemicallab brewing elixers, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge.

## Roleplaying an Alchemist
Alchemists pursue scientific innovation above all else, combining incredible powers from the natural world through the force of their keen intellect and insatiable curiosity.

**If you're an alchemist, you'll likely...**
*  Enjoy tinkering with strange forumlas and alchemical reagents, often with single-minded dedication and recklessness that give others pause.
*  Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctons you've made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt.
*  Endlessly experiment toward the discovery of new, more potent alchemical and magical tools.

**Others probably...**
*  Think you're at least a bit strange and don't understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention.
*  Fear that your creations are dangerous or volatile - or both.
*  Assume that if you haven't caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will.
*  Think that you're some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don't understand that you're not a spellcaster.  Real spellcasters clumsily dabbling in alchemy only heighten this misconception.

## Class Features
You gain these abilities as an alchemist.  Abilities gained at higher levels list the requisite levels next to the features' names.

### Advanced Alchemy
You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (see page 162), even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four additional common 1st-level alchemical formulas that feat grants.  The list of alchemical items begins on page 360. You can use this feat to create common alchemical items as long as you have their formulas in your formula book, though their power is fleeting.  You can create these items in two different ways, as described below.  An alchemical item you create this way has the infused trait.

First, during your daily preparations (described on page 332), you can create items sfor which you have the formulas.  Creating items this way requires spending 1 Resonance Point to create a batch of alchemical items of that type with the infused trait.  You select how many items are in the batch, up to half the normal maximum batch size (half a typical batch is two items, but see the Crafting Trained Activities section on page for more information) ***Note, the original rulebook has a misprint, leaving out the page number here***.  You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore the number of days typically required to create the items and any requirements of alchemical reagents.  You can't overspend Resonance Points to create infused items in this way during your daily preparations. 

Second, you can create alchemical items with the Quick Alchemy action, described below.

### Formula Book
You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less (as detailed on page 186) for free.  The formula book contains formulas for your choice of 4 common 1st-level alchemical items.  The list of alchemical items begins on page 360.

Each time you gain a new level, you can add formulas for two alchemical items to your formula book.  These can be of any level of item you can create.  You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible for you to find or buy other formulas, or to invent them with the Inventor feat (see page 167).

<blockquote class="note" markdown="1">
**Note:** Alchemists start with 8 formulas in their formula book; 4 from the Alchemical Crafting feat, and 4 with their Formula Book.
</blockquote>

### Studied Resonance
Knowledge, rather than personality, fuels your interactions with alchemical and magical substances and devices.  Your maximum number of Resonance Points is equal to your character level plus your Intelligence modifier (instead of your Charisma modifier).

### Alchemist Feats
At 1st level and every even numbered level thereafter, you gain an Alchemist class feat.  Alchemist class feats are described on page 48.

### Skill Feats (2nd)
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.  Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait.  You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

### Empower Bombs (3rd)
When you craft an alchemical item with the bomb and infused traits - hereafter referred to in this entry as a bomb - you can empower it.  You can only empower a 1st level bomb, increasing its level and causing it to do more damage. This also increases any persistent damage dealt by the bomb, but not it's splash damage.
*  At 3rd level, you can create 3rd-level bombs that deal double the bomb's base damage as presented in its entry. For instance, if you created a 3rd-level empowered alchemist's fire (see page 360), it would deal 2d6 fire damage, 2 persistent fire damage, and 1 splash damage on a hit.
*  At 7th level, you can create 7th-level bombs that deal three times the base damage.
*  At 11th level, you can create 11th-level bombs that deal four times the base damage. 
*  At 15th level, you can create 15th-level bombs that deal 5 times the base damage, and attack rolls with your empowered bombs gain a +1 item bonus.
*  At 19th level,  you can create 19th-level bombs that deal 6 times the base damage, and attack rolls with your empowered bombs gain a +2 item bonus.

### General Feats (3rd)
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.  General feats are listed in Chapter 5.

### Skill Increases (3rd)
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase.  You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in a skill in which you are already trained. 

If you're at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you are already an expert.  If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you are already a master.

### Mutagen Crafting (5th)
You learn the secrets of mutagens.  When you gain a new level and add new formulas to your formula book, you can select formulas for uncommon alchemical items with the mutagen trait.

### Ability Boosts (5th)
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores.  You can use these boosts to increase your ability scores above 18.  Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.

### Ancestry Feats (5th)
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.  The list of Ancestry feats open to you can be found in your ancestry's entry in Chapter 2.  

### Expanded Resonance (9th)
You gain a number of bonus Resonance Points equal to half your level.  You can use these bonus Resonance Points only when using the Quick Alchemy action.

### Double Elixer (13th)
When using the Quick Alchemy action, instead of using 1 Resonance Point to create a single item, you can spend up to 2 Resonance Points to make up to 2 alchemical items as described in that action.  Those items need not be the same.

### Alchemical Alacrity  (17th)
When using the Quick Alchemy action, instead of using 1 Resonance Point to create a single item, you can spend up to 3 Resonance Points to make up to 3 alchemical items as described in that action.  Those items need not be the same.
