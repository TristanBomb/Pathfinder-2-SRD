# Alchemist
> There’s no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling
in your laboratory’s beakers, and you consume your various creations
with abandon. Perhaps you’re fascinated with uncovering the secrets of
magic and science, or perhaps you simply like to watch volatile chemical
reactions. Regardless, you’re constantly experimenting in your lab or on
the go with inventive concoctions tweaked for any eventuality. With your
fearlessness in the face of risk, your unique path toward greatness is lined
with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits.

## Playing an Alchemist
Players of alchemist characters might approach gameplay in the following ways:
*  During combat, you lob bombs at your foes and harry your enemies while supporting the rest of your party with your potent elixirs.  At higher levels, you toughen your body using mutagens.
*  During social encounters, you provide knowledge and experience about alchemicalitems and related secrets, like poisons and diseases.
*  In exploration mode, you keep an eye out for truoble with your bombs at the ready while giving advice on all things alchemical and mysterious.
*  In downtime mode, you spend time in an alchemicallab brewing elixers, making bombs, and furthering your alchemical knowledge.

## Roleplaying an Alchemist
Alchemists pursue scientific innovation above all else, combining incredible powers from the natural world through the force of their keen intellect and insatiable curiosity.

**If you're an alchemist, you'll likely...**
*  Enjoy tinkering with strange forumlas and alchemical reagents, often with single-minded dedication and recklessness that give others pause.
*  Get a kick out of wreaking havoc with the alchemical concoctons you've made, and enjoy watching things burn, dissolve, freeze, and jolt.
*  Endlessly experiment toward the discovery of new, more potent alchemical and magical tools.

**Others probably...**
*  Think you're at least a bit strange and don't understand your zeal for alchemy, creativity, and invention.
*  Fear that your creations are dangerous or volatile - or both.
*  Assume that if you haven't caused a catastrophe with your experimentations, you inevitably will.
*  Think that you're some kind of sorcerer or an eccentric wizard and don't understand that you're not a spellcaster.  Real spellcasters clumsily dabbling in alchemy only heighten this misconception.

## Class Features
You gain these abilities as an alchemist.  Abilities gained at higher levels list the requisite levels next to the features' names.

### Advanced Alchemy
You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (see page 162), even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites, and you gain the four additional common 1st-level alchemical formulas that feat grants.  The list of alchemical items begins on page 360. You can use this feat to create common alchemical items as long as you have their formulas in your formula book, though their power is fleeting.  You can create these items in two different ways, as described below.  An alchemical item you create this way has the infused trait.

First, during your daily preparations (described on page 332), you can create items sfor which you have the formulas.  Creating items this way requires spending 1 Resonance Point to create a batch of alchemical items of that type with the infused trait.  You select how many items are in the batch, up to half the normal maximum batch size (half a typical batch is two items, but see the Crafting Trained Activities section on page for more information) ***Note, the original rulebook has a misprint, leaving out the page number here***.  You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore the number of days typically required to create the items and any requirements of alchemical reagents.  You can't overspend Resonance Points to create infused items in this way during your daily preparations. 

Second, you can create alchemical items with the Quick Alchemy action, described below.

### Quick Alchemy 
Placeholder for the template

### Formula Book
You start with a standard formula book worth 10 sp or less (as detailed on page 186) for free.  The formula book contains formulas for your choice of 4 common 1st-level alchemical items.  The list of alchemical items begins on page 360.

Each time you gain a new level, you can add formulas for two alchemical items to your formula book.  These can be of any level of item you can create.  You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible for you to find or buy other formulas, or to invent them with the Inventor feat (see page 167).

<blockquote class="note" markdown="1">
**Note:** Alchemists start with 8 formulas in their formula book; 4 from the Alchemical Crafting feat, and 4 with their Formula Book.
</blockquote>

### Studied Resonance
Knowledge, rather than personality, fuels your interactions with alchemical and magical substances and devices.  Your maximum number of Resonance Points is equal to your character level plus your Intelligence modifier (instead of your Charisma modifier).

### Alchemist Feats
At 1st level and every even numbered level thereafter, you gain an Alchemist class feat.  Alchemist class feats are described on page 48.

### Skill Feats (2nd)
At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.  Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait.  You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

### Empower Bombs (3rd)
When you craft an alchemical item with the bomb and infused traits - hereafter referred to in this entry as a bomb - you can empower it.  You can only empower a 1st level bomb, increasing its level and causing it to do more damage. This also increases any persistent damage dealt by the bomb, but not it's splash damage.
*  At 3rd level, you can create 3rd-level bombs that deal double the bomb's base damage as presented in its entry. For instance, if you created a 3rd-level empowered alchemist's fire (see page 360), it would deal 2d6 fire damage, 2 persistent fire damage, and 1 splash damage on a hit.
*  At 7th level, you can create 7th-level bombs that deal three times the base damage.
*  At 11th level, you can create 11th-level bombs that deal four times the base damage. 
*  At 15th level, you can create 15th-level bombs that deal 5 times the base damage, and attack rolls with your empowered bombs gain a +1 item bonus.
*  At 19th level,  you can create 19th-level bombs that deal 6 times the base damage, and attack rolls with your empowered bombs gain a +2 item bonus.

### General Feats (3rd)
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.  General feats are listed in Chapter 5.

### Skill Increases (3rd)
At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase.  You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or become an expert in a skill in which you are already trained. 

If you're at least 7th level, you can use this increase to become a master in a signature skill in which you are already an expert.  If you are at least 15th level, you can use this increase to become legendary in a signature skill in which you are already a master.

### Mutagen Crafting (5th)
You learn the secrets of mutagens.  When you gain a new level and add new formulas to your formula book, you can select formulas for uncommon alchemical items with the mutagen trait.

### Ability Boosts (5th)
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores.  You can use these boosts to increase your ability scores above 18.  Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.

### Ancestry Feats (5th)
In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.  The list of Ancestry feats open to you can be found in your ancestry's entry in Chapter 2.  

### Expanded Resonance (9th)
You gain a number of bonus Resonance Points equal to half your level.  You can use these bonus Resonance Points only when using the Quick Alchemy action.

### Double Elixer (13th)
When using the Quick Alchemy action, instead of using 1 Resonance Point to create a single item, you can spend up to 2 Resonance Points to make up to 2 alchemical items as described in that action.  Those items need not be the same.

### Alchemical Alacrity  (17th)
When using the Quick Alchemy action, instead of using 1 Resonance Point to create a single item, you can spend up to 3 Resonance Points to make up to 3 alchemical items as described in that action.  Those items need not be the same.

## Alchemist Feats
At every level that you gain an alchemist feat, you can select one of the following feats.  You must satisfy any prerequisites before selecting an alchemist feat.

### 1st Level
#### Alchemical Familiar  (Feat, 1)
You have created life via alchemy, though only a simple creature formed from alchemical materials and a bit of your own blood.  This alchemical familiar assists you in your laboratory and adventuring, like any other familiar (see Familiars on page 287 for more information).

#### Alchemical Savant  (Feat, 1)
You can identify alchemical items quickly.  When trained in the Arcana skill and attempting to use its Identify Magic action (see page 145) on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action with the concentrate and manipulate traits instead of taking an hour.  If you have the formula for the item you are attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check and treat any critical failures as failures instead.

####Far Lobber  (Feat, 1)
You've learned techniques to improve your distance throwing.  When you throw an alchemical bomb, it has a range increment of 30 feet instead of the usual 20 feet.

#### Quick Bomber  (Feat, 1)
You place your bombs in easy-to-reach pouches and learn how to draw them almost without thinking.  When you use the Interact action (see page 307) to draw an alchemical item with the bomb trait, you can draw two bombs instead.  When using Quick Alchemy to create a bomb, you can also draw one other bomb as part of the Quick Alchemy action.

#### Smoke Bomb  (Feat, 1) - 1 action cost
**Additive**

**Frequency:** Once per round

**Trigger:** You craft an alchemical bomb using the Quick Alchemy action.

You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke in addition to its normal effects.  When thrown, it creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst.  You can choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on.  All creatures within that area are concealed (see page 302).  The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated with a strong wind.

### 4th Level
#### Calculated Splash  (Feat, 4)
You can calculate the angle that maximizes the damage of a bomb's splash.  When you throw an alchemical item of 3rd level or higher with the bomb and splash traits, you can choose for the bomb's splash damage to deal extra damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0) instead of the normal amount.

#### Efficient Alchemy  (Feat, 4)
Because of the great amount of time you've spent studying and experimenting, you know how to scale up your formulas to larger batches without giving them any additional attention.  When spending downtime to Craft alchemical items, you can produce twice the number of alchemical items in a single batch without needing to spend additional preparatory time.  For instance, if you are crafting elixers of life, you can craft up to four elixirs in a single batch using downtime, rather than two.  This does not reduce the amount of required alchemical reagents or other ingredients needed to craft each item, nor does it increase your rate of progress for the days past the base downtime spent.  This also does not change the number of items you can create in a batch with advanced alchemy.

#### Enduring Alchemy  (Feat, 4)
When using Quick Alchemy to create an alchemical tool or elixer, you can enable that tool or elixir to remain potent until the end of your next turn, instead of it losing its potency at the start of your next turn.

#### Poison Resistance  (Feat, 4)
You gain poison resistance equal to half of your level, and a +1 conditional bonus to saving throws against poisons.

### 6th Level
#### Debilitating Bomb  (Feat, 6)

**Additive**

**Frequency:** Once per round

**Trigger:** You craft an alchemical item that has the elixir trait using the Quick Alchemy action.

You mix a substance into the bomb that can cause one of the following conditions:  dazzled, deafened, flat-footed, or hampered 5.  If the attack with that bomb hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or gain that condition until the start of your next turn.  Use your class DC for this saving throw (even if someone else throws the bomb).

#### Delayed Bomb  (Feat, 6)
When using Quick Alchemy to craft an alchemical item with the bomb trait, you can build it to explode automatically after a certain matter of time.  This delay can be up to any number of rounds up to your level, chosen when you craft the bomb.  When this delayed bomb explodes, it deals damage to a creature within its square as if that creature had been hit by an attack with the bomb (if there are multiple creatures in the square, choose the target randomly).  It also does its splash damage (if any) as if you had thrown the bomb at the target.
Unlike other items crafted with the Quick Alchemy action, the delayed bomb remains potent until it explodes or you defuse it.  You can use the Interact action with a delayed bomb you made in order to defuse it.  Other creatures can try to Disable a Device to defuse the bomb, using your Class DC for the Thievery check.

#### Fast Onset  (Feat, 6)
When you drink one of your alchemical items that has the elixir and infused traits and an onset time of 1 minute, treat the item's onset as the end of your next turn instead.  When you drink one of your infused elixirs with an onset time that's normally at the end of your next turn, the elixir has no onset time and takes effect immediately.

#### Poison Antidote  (Feat, 6)
**Prerequisite:** Poison Resistance
You can use Quick Alchemy to create a specific antidote to any single specific poison or venom you have identified.  When imbibed or injected as an Operate Activation, this specific antidote attempts to counteract that poison or venom using a counteract level equal to half your level rounded up.  If you use the specific antidote on yourself and you have the formula for the poison or venom affecting you, increase the counteract level of the specific antidote by 1.  For more about counteracting poisons, see page 319.

#### Precise Bombs  (Feat, 6)
When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, the splash damage does not affect your allies.  You must be able to perceive an ally to exlude that ally from your bomb's splash damage.

### 8th Level
#### Combine Elixirs  (Feat, 8)  - 1 action
**Additive**

**Frequency:** Once per round

**Trigger:** You craft an alchemical item that has the elixir trait using the Quick Alchemy action.

You've discovered how to mix two elixirs into a single concotion for quicker consumption.  You can spend 3 Resonance Points instead of 1 Resonance Point to add a second elixir to the one you're crafting.  When this combination elixir is consumed, both the constituent elixirs take effect.  For example, you can combine two of the same elixirs to a combined elixir of life that heals double the amount.  If a creature other than you drinks a combined elixir, it must spend 2 Resonance Points to gain the effects instead of only 1 Resonance Point.

#### Feral Mutagen  (Feat, 8)
Your feral mutagen truly brings out the beast lurking within you.  Whenever you're affected by a feral mutagen, you gain the mutagen's item bonus to your Intimidation checks.  You also gain two new unarmed Strikes:  one with your claws and one with your jaws.  Your claws and jaws both have the agile weapon trait.  Your claws deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier (plus the extra dice from your mutagen), while your jaws deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 plus your Strength modifier (plus the extra dice from your mutagen).

#### Powerful Alchemy  (Feat, 8)
When you use Quick Alchemy to create an infused alchemical item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC.

#### Strong Medicine  (Feat, 8)
When you use Quick Alchemy to create any type of elixir of life, the creature drinking the elixir gains both its healing effect and any effect the elixir grants against toxins, even if the drinker was not at full HP when consuming the elixier.

#### Tricky Tinker  (Feat, 8)
Deception and Thievery become signature skills for you.  When you Disable Device, you can use alchemist's tools or a repair kit instead of thieves' tools (see pages 184 and 187).

### 10th Level
#### Expanded Splash  (Feat, 10)
**Prerequisite:** Calculated Splash

When you throw an alchemical bomb with the splash trait that you have created, the splash damage is increased to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier, and it damages every creature within 10 feet of the target.

#### Greater Debilitating Bomb  (Feat, 10)
**Prerequisite:** Debilitating Bomb

When you use the Debilitating Bomb free action, add the following conditions to the list you can choose from:  enfeebled 1, hampered 10, sluggish 1, or stupefied 1.

#### Potent Poisoner  (Feat, 10)
**Prerequisite:** Powerful Alchemy

When you craft an alchemical item with the poison trait using any means, the DC is increased by 2, to a maximum of your class DC.

#### Revivifying Mutagen  (Feat, 10)
While under the effects of a mutagen, you can metabolize that mutagen's power to heal yourself.  This takes an action with the concentrate and manipulate trait.  Once the action is complete, you regain 1d6 HP for every 2 item levels of the mutagen, but the mutagen's duration immediately ends, even if you are under the effect of Persistent Mutagen.

#### Stalker Mutagen  (Feat, 10)
Stealth becomes a signature skill for you.  When you are under the effects of a quicksilver mutagen (see page 367), you can move up to your speed when you sneak.

#### Sticky Bomb  (Feat, 10)  - 1 action
**Additive**

**Frequency:** Once per Round

**Trigger:** You craft an alchemical elixir using the Quick Alchemy action.

You mix in an additive to make the bomb's contents adhere to the target and continue to do damage.  A creature that takes a direct hit from one of your sticky bombs also takes persistent damage equal to and of the same type as the bomb's splash damage.
